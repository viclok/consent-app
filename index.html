    <h1>Procedure Consent</h1>
    <h2>About your procedure</h2>
    <p>In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. 
    Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations 
    in the UK and its success rate is excellent. The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), 
    which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.
    Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst 
    or access is more difficult. Most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although 
    strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6 weeks after open surgery. </p>
